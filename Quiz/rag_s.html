        <h4 style="margin-left: 5px"><u>Races</h2></u><br>

        <div style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 15px">A contest of speed in running, riding, driving, sailing or rowing is called a race.</div>
        <br><br>

        <h4 style="margin-left: 5px"><u>Race Course</h2></u><br>
            <div style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 15px">The ground or path on which contests are made is called a race course.</div>
        <br><br> 

        <h4 style="margin-left: 5px"><u>Starting Point</h2></u><br>
            <div style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 15px">The point from which a race begins is known as a starting point.</div>
        <br><br>

        <h4 style="margin-left: 5px"><u>Winning Point or Goal</h2></u><br>
            <div style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 15px">The point set to bound a race is called a winning point or a goal.</div>
        <br><br>

        <h4 style="margin-left: 5px"><u>Winner</h2></u><br>
            <div style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 15px">The person who first reaches the winning point is called a winner.</div>
        <br><br>

        <h4 style="margin-left: 5px"><u>Dead Heat Race</h2></u><br>
            <div style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 15px">If all the persons contesting a race reach the goal exactly at the same time, the race is said to be dead heat race.</div>
        <br><br>

        <h4 style="margin-left: 5px"><u>Start</h2></u><br>
            <div style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 15px">Suppose A and B are two contestants in a race. If before the start of the race, A is at the starting point and B is ahead of A by 12 metres, then we say that 'A gives B, a start of 12 metres'.

             <br>   To cover a race of 100 metres in this case, A will have to cover 100 metres while B will have to cover only (100 - 12) = 88 metres.
                
                <br>In a 100 race, 'A can give B 12 m' or 'A can give B a start of 12 m' or 'A beats B by 12 m' means that while A runs 100 m, B runs (100 - 12) = 88 m.</div>
        <br><br>

        <h4 style="margin-left: 5px"><u>Games</h2></u><br>
            <div style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 15px">'A game of 100, means that the person among the contestants who scores 100 points first is the winner'.<br>

                If A scores 100 points while B scores only 80 points, then we say that 'A can give B 20 points'.</div>
